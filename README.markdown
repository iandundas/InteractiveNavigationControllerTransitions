#Interactive Push and Pop NavigationController Transitions

I needed a way to add interactive pull and push interactions to a NavigationController, as I was trying to replicate the awesome swipe-through-ViewControllers introduction used in the Argus app. (It could have been built in several different ways, but to learn iOS7 custom transitions I decided to go this way).

I couldn't find any relevant examples online, so here's my attempt.

All feedback welcome.
